## Linear Learner | Predict quatitative value based on numeric input | Dense Continues Data
- Predict number (regression) or value below or above some threshhold (classification
- Adjust to Minimize error and get an equation for a line.
- To achive lowest possible on the map (error) uses Stochastic Gradient Descent

### In Classification
To find local minimum and then global minimum

## Factorization Machine | Sparse data (missing values) and not Dense Data
- considers only pair-wise features
- csv is not supported
- Doesnt work for multiclass problem
- needs lots of data
- does not perform well on dense data
- better work on CPU
