# Deep Learning Algorithms

## Neural Networks | Sup | Classification
Bias: helps to not get deactivation of neuron having -ve x value up to certain threshold.

Equation: A x + B
A - input
x - weights
B - Bias

## Convolutional Neural Networks CNN | Sup | Classification
Example: Image classification, spatial analysis, hotdog or not

Process image layer by layer over edge detection filter or multiple other filters

## Recurrent Neural Network | Sup | Other
Example: Stock Prediction, Time Serries, Voice recognition (Seq2Seq), 
PATTERN which says Start activity - following certain sequence - End activity
